Abstract
========

Biological soil crusts (BSC) are key components of ecosystem
productivity contributing significantly to the nitrogen (N) budget of
arid ecosystems. N~2~-fixation in BSC is generally attributed to
heterocystous cyanobacteria. Published surveys of BSC *nifH* gene
content show that *nifH* genes PCR amplified and sequenced from mature and
early successional BSC are predominantly cyanobacterial. Early successional
crusts, however, possess few N~2~-fixing cyanobacteria but can still fix N~2~
at rates comparable to mature crusts and this suggests that microorganisms
other than cyanobacteria mediate N~2~-fixation during the early stages of BSC
development. DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) with ^15^N~2~ revealed that
*Clostridiaceae* and *Proteobacteria* are the most common microorganisms that
assimilate ^15^N in early successional crusts. Specifically, 34 OTUs were found
to incorporate ^15^N from ^15^N~2~ during experimental incubations.
^15^N-responsive OTUs were members of the *Firmicutes* (19 OTUs),
*Proteobacteria* (12 OTUs), *Actinobacteria* (2 OTUs) and *Gemmatimonadetes* (1
OTU). Thirty-eight percent of ^15^N-responsive OTUs have been observed
previously in published SSU rRNA gene surveys of BSC though at low
abundance (median non-zero abundance of 5 x 10^-4^). ^15^N-responsive OTUs that
belong to *Firmicutes* were predominantly *Clostridiaceae*. Proteobacterial
^15^N-responsive OTUs were predominantly *Gammaproteobacteria* and
proteobacterial OTUs that conclusively incorporated ^15^N~2~ into biomass
shared at least 95% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with isolates commonly
associated with N~2~-fixation including *Pseudomonas*, *Klebsiella*,
*Shigella*, and *Ideonella*. The low abundance of non-phototrophic diazotrophs
in BSC may explain why they have not previously been characterized. Diazotrophs
play a critical role in BSC formation and characterization of these organisms
represents a crucial step towards understanding how anthropogenic change will
affect the formation and ecological function of BSC in arid ecosystems.
